            <h1>Android Mascot History</h1>

            <p>Probably you know the <strong>Android</strong> OS, it maintained by <strong>Google</strong> it's one of the most users for mobile devices around world. But did you know it's simpatic mascot have a name and a very curious history? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>

            <h2>First Version</h2>

            <p>The first try to create a mascot emerged in 2007 and come from a developer named Dan Morrill. The first try to create a mascot emerged in 2007 and come from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" rel="external" class= "external">Dan Morrill</a>. He tells opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" rel="external" class= "external">Inkscape</a> (open source software to vectorize images) and create the first version of his robot. The objective was just to person the system just for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This first bizarre version was even named in homage of its creator: They were the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>

            <h2 class="small">A new mascot appears</h2>

            <p>The idea to have a mascot was maturing and the mission was passed on to a area professional. The russian illustrer <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="_blank" rel="external" class= "external">Irina Blok</a>, also Google employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

            </picture>

            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few lines and in a flatter way. The drawing should also generate quick identification with whoever looks at it. That's how <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, Android's new mascot, came about.</p>

            <img class="small" src="imgs/bugdroid.png" alt="Bugdroid">

            <p>The main inspiration for the new <strong>Bugdroid's</strong> features came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the type of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in the <strong>Google</strong> office and looked at the side of the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>

                <p>Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a sweet, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                    <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Eclair</li>
                    <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                    <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                    <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                    <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
                    <li>4.4 - KitKat</li>
                    <li>5.0 - Lolipop</li>
                    <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                    <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
                    <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                    <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
                </ul>                

                <p>Unfortunately, the <strong>Android Q</strong> did not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbering, which gave rise to Android 10.</p>
